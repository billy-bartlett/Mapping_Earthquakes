# Mapping Earthquakes
This repository contains two earthquake maps with three different map style options and a tectonic plate overlay. I have also added the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on Earth. All earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 are displayed on the map in a pink color range. There is also an option to toggle the map style and earthquake data to fit your needs.
